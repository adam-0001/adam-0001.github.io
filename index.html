						<h3>About</h3>
						<p>
							As a student at the University of Washington, I continue to pursue
							my passion for the intersection of computer science and business,
							I've spent the past few years exploring the ways in which
							technology and entrepreneurship intersect. My hands-on experience
							starting several small online businesses has given me practical
							knowledge of various technologies, modern programming languages
							(e.g. Python, Go, and JS), and e-commerce platforms.
						</p>
						<p>
							I have a strong commitment to continuous learning and am always
							seeking to expand my knowledge and skills. I approach challenges
							with a team-first mentality, believing that collaboration,
							transparency, experimentation, and the willingness to embrace
							failure are keys to success. My ultimate aim is to use my passions
							and skills to create impactful digital products that solve
							real-world problems.
						</p>
						<h3>What I'm Currently Working On</h3>
						<p>
							I'm currently exploring AI and its applications in the field of
							cybersecurity! I'm also working on a few personal projects, one of
							which is a mobile app that allows users to share, save, and create
							recipes with friends and family.
